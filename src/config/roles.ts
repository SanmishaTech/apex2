// - Only ADMIN retains CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE project, MANAGE_PROJECT_USERS, and file upload/delete.
// - Authorization enforcement for "its own project" must be done at the resolver/service layer:
//   1) Check the user has READ_PROJECT / READ_PROJECT_FILE.
//   2) Verify membership via ProjectUser join before returning restricted data.
// - You may expose helper guards to combine permission + membership check.
